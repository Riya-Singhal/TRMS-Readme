TRMS website is made with a motive to reduce the paper work required to book auditorium and other activity rooms in colleges. One can book room, view their bookings and cancel their bookings as per their comfort. 
There would be two categories of users: 1. User 2. Admin
# Options for admin:
1. Create new ids
2. Delete any id
3. Book a room 
4. View all bookings of all users specific to a room or date etc
5. View his/her bookings
6. Cancel booking
# Options for user:
1. Book a room
2. View bookings
3. Cancel booking

While booking room, a user would be required to enter the details regarding their requirements, date and time of booking and purpose of booking and then they would be shown blocks and buildings where such rooms are available and then on selecting the blocks they can select the room number and get a confirmation about room booking.And similar would be the procedures for other tasks.
